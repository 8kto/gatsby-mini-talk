# Storybook: Automatic tools
## Loki
[Loki](https://github.com/oblador/loki) allows you to create the reference images to test your stories against. 
These images should be checked into your git repository, optionally stored using `git-lfs`. 

**Slower, screenshots stored locally, free**.

## Chromatic
[Chromatic](https://docs.chromaticqa.com/) is a Storybook addon that automatically turns your stories into visual test specifications.
The addon uploads your Storybook bundle to **cloud** infrastructure where your tests run in parallel in a consistent browser environment.

**Faster, paid, no need for screenshots stored in repository.**
