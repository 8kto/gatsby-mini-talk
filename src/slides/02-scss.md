# Adding SCSS

All we need is:
 
```bash
# Install packages
yarn add node-sass gatsby-plugin-sass
```

* Add new plugins to `plugins` section in `gatsby-config.js`.

* `gatsby-config.js` â€” is a special file with gatsby-specific options.
 
Besides all of the other options, it has a list of active plugins.
